This function enables trading operations by setting the `tradingEnabled` variable to `true`.

### `HaltTrading()`
This function disables trading operations by setting the `tradingEnabled` variable to `false`.

It also checks if the hedge limit is reached, and if so, it halts trading operations. Finally, it implements the trading strategy using the RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR, and the specified symbols.

## Product Description
Rosaline Forex Software is an advanced Expert Advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It combines the power of the RSI indicator, Bollinger Bands, and the ATR indicator to execute trades in the forex market with precision and accuracy.

With Rosaline Forex Software, traders can benefit from its unique capital protection feature, which limits trading operations based on a specified hedge limit as a percentage of the account balance. This ensures that the risk is controlled, and potential losses are minimized.

The RSI indicator is a popular technical analysis tool that measures the strength and weakness of a currency pair. By incorporating the RSI indicator into its trading strategy, Rosaline Forex Software identifies overbought and oversold conditions, allowing traders to enter and exit trades at optimal levels.

The Bollinger Bands indicator adds an additional layer of analysis to the trading strategy. By plotting two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, the Bollinger Bands help identify volatility and potential price reversals, enabling traders to make informed trading decisions.

The ATR indicator, on the other hand, measures market volatility and provides valuable insights into potential price movements. By incorporating the ATR indicator into its trading strategy, Rosaline Forex Software adapts to changing market conditions and adjusts its trading approach accordingly.

Rosaline Forex Software also supports trading with specific symbols, such as Gold (XAU), Euro (EU), and Orange Juice (OJ). This allows traders to focus on the most profitable opportunities in the market and maximize their potential returns.
